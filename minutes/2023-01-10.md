## Minutes


>**concurrency** is the ability of different parts or units of a [program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program "Computer program"), [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm"), or [problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving "Problem solving") to be [executed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_(computing) "Execution (computing)") out-of-order or in [partial order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_Order "Partial Order"), without affecting the outcome.

With respect to Cardano, the problem is when more then one transaction reference same UTXO. The point is, solving this problem repeatedly by project teams is wasteful and improving this can make Cardano more competitive among other protocols;

What is needed is to scope this idea, produce a roadmap to implementation, assess impact and risks. 
For example, this could expose end users to new vectors of attack, but will make Cardano more attractive to a subset of developers; 

Who is affected? What is the impact? What are the drawbacks?
