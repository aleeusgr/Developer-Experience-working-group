# Minutes for Developer Experience Working Group - May 23, 2023

## Minutes
- Additional co-chair
    - Neil Rutledge will be assisting George Flerovsky as co-chair
    - Neil is a delivery manager at MLabs, but he focuses more on frontend/offchain and has been involved in multiple product launches on Cardano (in varying capacities)
- Future goals of Developer Experience Working Group
    - Bring in more developers from other communities
    - Identify common issues and create problem statements
    - Acquire funding for resolving issues through Catalyst proposals, etc.
- Scheduling meetings
    - It would be helpful to have a calendar invite so people don't miss meetings
    - George will look into creating an invite that people can import into their calendars
- Chain indexer pain points
    - There are several chain indexers and they all have varying degrees of limitations
    - Neil has experienced slow Kupo queries and timeouts (also reports of needing to spin up hundreds of instances to meet production loads) but needs to investigate further
    - Andrew Westberg is building an indexer for [NEWM](https://github.com/projectNEWM/newm-server) that has a gRPC API, can watch smart contracts (event driven), and has client code generation
- Synching types between languages
    - There is currently difficulty keeping types aligned between Haskell/PureScript/TypeScript, etc.
    - [Lambda Buffers](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/lambda-buffers) is working on a solution
    - [CIP-0057](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0057) is another potential solution
    - The ability to generate type definitions (blueprints) could be added to Plutarch and PlutusTx
- Other issues warranting further discussion
    - Frontend integration is generally more challenging than it should be
    - It's difficult to assess how DApps will scale/behave on mainnet (a testnet more closely matching mainnet would be helpful)

## Actions
- George - Post calendar invite in Discord for future meetings
- Neil - Get more details on potential kupo issues and other integration issues for further discussion
