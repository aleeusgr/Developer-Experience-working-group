## Minutes for Tues, Nov 21, 2022

**Attendees:**

**Interested parties:**


**Agenda:** 
* dApp testing. 
* Going through current issues is recommended.


## From Discord:
- Ben, MLabs: 
>we use [plutip](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/plutip) for testing on a disposable chain and [plutus-simple-model](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/plutus-simple-model) for doing property or unit tests - it tests using the same validation functions that the ledger does - but unlike plutip it doesn't run a full blockchain so it's easier to run high volumes of simple tests.



- Philip DiSarro: 
>`AproposTx` is great MLabs testing tool, it extends `hedgehog` with plutus specific functionality, and allows generating comprehensive Script Contexts for property based testing.

- Simon Thompson:
  - IOG released a [survey](https://input-output.typeform.com/to/qQf29lv1),  please invest time into completing it. 

- Santiago [TxPipe]:

>Action items on my side are:
>- Identify anyone interested in contributing to well-architected documentation effort. @jamesdunseith-gimbalabs and @BenHart-mlabs have already volunteered (ping me if interested).
>- Reach consensus on an preliminary scope for the framework (topics, level of detail, etc)



**Actions:**
1. Santiago, @jamesdunseith-gimbalabs and @BenHart-mlabs: <br>
Reach consensus on an preliminary scope for [Cardano Well-Architected Framework](https://github.com/input-output-hk/Developer-Experience-working-group/issues/28) (topics, level of detail, etc)
2. Alex: keep minutes. 
3. Alex: Ask 3 developers not present at the meeting about their thoughts on testing. 


## Questions:

* What testing tools are missing?
* How do we facilitate development of testing standards similar to Cardano Well-Architected Framework


## Minutes:

IOG wants to rise awareness and create a community-owned initiative to define testing standards and create a set of standards for testing smart contracts in Cardano. 

Nick Nicely: using unit tests, the project is aimed at sustainability and onboarding new developers, the tool is and API written in Go to generate Marlowe code.

Matthias, Loxe Inc: using nix in onboarding projects like Gimbalabs PPBL increases barriers to entry for new developers, there should be a tool to create local testnet using docker.
