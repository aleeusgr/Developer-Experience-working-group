## From Discord:
- Ben, MLabs: 
>we use [plutip](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/plutip) for testing on a disposable chain and [plutus-simple-model](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/plutus-simple-model) for doing property or unit tests - it tests using the same validation functions that the ledger does - but unlike plutip it doesn't run a full blockchain so it's easier to run high volumes of simple tests.



- Philip DiSarro: 
>`AproposTx` is great MLabs testing tool, it extends `hedgehog` with plutus specific functionality, and allows generating comprehensive Script Contexts for property based testing.

- Simon Thompson:
  - IOG released a [survey](https://input-output.typeform.com/to/qQf29lv1),  please invest time into completing it. 

- Santiago [TxPipe]:
