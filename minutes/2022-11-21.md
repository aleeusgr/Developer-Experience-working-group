## Minutes:

**Agenda** @Simon Thompson Wanted to talk about testing.

Ben, MLabs:  
we use `plutip` for testing on a disposable chain and `plutus-simple-model` for doing property or unit tests - it tests using the same validation functions that the ledger does - but unlike plutip it doesn't run a full blockchain so it's easier to run high volumes of simple tests.

Philip DiSarro: 
`AproposTx` is great MLabs testing tool, it extends `hedgehog` with plutus specific functionality, and allows generating comprehensive Script Contexts for property based testing.
