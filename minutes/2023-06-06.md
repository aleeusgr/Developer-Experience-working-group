# Minutes for Developer Experience Working Group - June 06, 2023

## Minutes
- Chair: Neil Rutledge, Ignacio [minute-taker]

- Preferably to self-host services (if the resources for experienced DevOps exists) than relying on third party services: eg. Blockfrost, Maestro
    - Members of the WG have seen projects using a diversity of tools like Lucid, Kupo and CTL
    
- More specifically Kupo is very good out of the box, because it allows to selectively deal w/ specific UTXOs. However, some limitations are:
    - it needs to separately look up scripts and data, which results in additional requests
    - Handling separate caching is often needed, some projects opt to build their own indexer or add extra caching layers to Kupo
    - Some project w/ heavy load needs is using dynamic scripts w/ different parameterizations, in comination to an additional indexer on top of Kupo

- Marconi is IOG's chain indexer library
    - aims to monitor bridges for side-chains
    - the design considers to offer precise customization -> efficient and low-cost
    - will keep the WG updated

- PR for Plutus elliptic functions pairing has been merged, but didn't make it to CHAPS Cardano Haskell repo yet
    - nix-haskell, has been somewhat of a blocker for finding the right packages
    - more specifically expecting this to be improved with a new version of Plutus
